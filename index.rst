Gender stats
============

* 1.1% women in FLOSS survey

* 1.6% in separate FLOSS-US survey

Survey methodology
==================

"Rather than selecting out a small, well-controlled sample...

we allowed respondents to decide for themselves whether they should be considered “developers”..."

"Our goal has been to analyze the entire... community."

Questions about Ghosh results
====


.. rst-class:: build

* Does Ghosh's survey find fewer women because it mostly surveyed people who start projects?

* Are the men in FLOSS and the women generally using separate hosting services?

* Are women under-represented because, as a group, they were less likely to fill out the survey?

Reflections: What are we measuring, and why?
====

.. rst-class:: build

* Academic factoids

  * Not actionable

* Being measured by people who don't have an interest in the results.

* Opt-in surveys are hopelessly broken,<br>unless you know, very clearly, who has responded and who did not. -- Benjamin Mako Hill

Reflections: Maybe...
=====

.. rst-class:: build

* ± 50% is good enough for activists

* But do we know it's +/- 50%?

* How do we measure progress?

Going forward, let's think about how to be useful.

Data recovery
====

Adjust response data to match Pew demographics, using logistic "propensity score" to model non-random selection.

.. rst-class:: build

* Female editors: 12.7% -> 16.1%

* Female editors in US: 17.8% -> 22.7%

* Credit: Benj. Mako Hill and Aaron Shaw<br>(Search: [hill shaw gender wikipedia pew])

* Conclusion: So close to 25% goal!

What they say vs. What they do
====

Wikipedia editor survey 2011:

* 70% say receiving a Barnstar makes them more likely to edit.

Shaw & Hill, 2012 (Shaw dissertation)

.. rst-class:: build

* Measure edit range over 5 weeks before and after receiving Barnstar

* Net: -1.72 edits per week change

* People who moved star to personal page: +3

* People who did not move star: -3

* Search: [shaw interactional account dissertation]

wikiHow demographics survey: motivation
====

.. rst-class:: build

* Inspired and shocked by Wikipedia Editor Survey results

* Wondered if they had same lack of gender diversity

* Ran a survey!

wikiHow demographics survey: methodology
====

.. rst-class:: build

* Over three weeks, find active users

* Send them a talk page message

* 50% response rate; N=126

* Send by the wikiHow community manager

wikiHow demographics survey: results

* 52% are 15 or younger

* 24% are 16-25

* The older the contributor, the more likely to be male.

* The more experienced the contributor, the more likely to be male.

How to increase data quality for opt-in surveys
====

.. rst-class:: build

* Ask readers to fill out the same survey

* Adjust contributor response rate using known demographics of readers
