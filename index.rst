Gender stats
============

* 1.1% women in FLOSS survey

* 1.6% in separate FLOSS-US survey

Survey methodology
==================

"Rather than selecting out a small, well-controlled sample...

we allowed respondents to decide for themselves whether they should be considered “developers”..."

"Our goal has been to analyze the entire... community."

Questions about Ghosh results
====


.. rst-class:: build

* Does Ghosh's survey find fewer women because it mostly surveyed people who start projects?

* Are the men in FLOSS and the women generally using separate hosting services?

* Are women under-represented because, as a group, they were less likely to fill out the survey?

Reflections: What are we measuring, and why?
====

.. rst-class:: build

* Academic factoids

  * Not actionable

* Being measured by people who don't have an interest in the results.

* Opt-in surveys are hopelessly broken,<br>unless you know, very clearly, who has responded and who did not. -- Benjamin Mako Hill

Reflections: Maybe...
=====

.. rst-class:: build

* ± 50% is good enough for activists

* But do we know it's +/- 50%?

* How do we measure progress?

Going forward, let's think about how to be useful.

2008 Wikipedia survey
===

.. rst-class:: build

* For 1 week, a link on the top of every page

* (I don't remember seeing it)

* Goals of suvey: Answer...

  * Why do people start+stop editing?

  * Do people know WMF is a non-profit?

  * What are Wikipedia editors' demographics?

* Collaboration between WMF and UNU-MERIT (Ghosh et al.)

Pew Survey, 2010

Data recovery
====

Adjust response data to match Pew demographics, using logistic "propensity score" to model non-random selection.

.. rst-class:: build

* Female editors: 12.7% -> 16.1%

* Female editors in US: 17.8% -> 22.7%

* Credit: Benj. Mako Hill and Aaron Shaw<br>(Search: [hill shaw gender wikipedia pew])

* Conclusion: So close to 25% goal!

What they say vs. What they do
====

Wikipedia editor survey 2011:

* 70% say receiving a Barnstar makes them more likely to edit.

Shaw & Hill, 2012 (Shaw dissertation)

.. rst-class:: build

* Measure edit range over 5 weeks before and after receiving Barnstar

* Net: -1.72 edits per week change

* People who moved star to personal page: +3

* People who did not move star: -3

* Search: [shaw interactional account dissertation]

wikiHow demographics survey: motivation
====

.. rst-class:: build

* Inspired and shocked by Wikipedia Editor Survey results

* Wondered if they had same lack of gender diversity

* Ran a survey!

wikiHow demographics survey: methodology
====

.. rst-class:: build

* Over three weeks, find active users

* Send them a talk page message

* 50% response rate; N=126

* Send by the wikiHow community manager

wikiHow demographics survey: results
====

.. rst-class:: build

* 56% of respondents were female

* 52% are 15 or younger

* 24% are 16-25

* The older the contributor, the more likely to be male.

* The more experienced the contributor, the more likely to be male.

How to increase data quality for opt-in surveys
====

.. rst-class:: build

* Ask readers to fill out the same survey

* Adjust contributor response rate using known demographics of readers

Questions about wikiHow data
=======

Questions:

.. rst-class:: build

* 50% of survey respondents under 15?

* Was gender mandatory to fill in?

* Which editing levels were more/less likely to respond?

Questions about wikiHow data
=======

Questions and answers:

.. rst-class:: build

* 50% of survey respondents under 15?

* Was gender mandatory to fill in?

* Which editing levels were more/less likely to respond?

.. rst-class:: build

* 19/123 people did not fill out age.

* Gender was required.

* We may never know which editing levels responded better.

Topic: Behavioral studies
=====

Debian mentorship, 2010: "Four days"
=====

.. rst-class:: build

* Can we review new contributors' packages within four days?

* If so, they know what to expect.

* Package review increased sharply at the start...

* and then we failed to meet our commitment...

* ...and flatlined to its old amount.

* Follow through is hard.

GNOME Women's Outreach Project
=====

Or: The First Great FLOSS Behavioral Study

.. rst-class:: build

* GSoC 2006: 181 applicants

* Women's Summer Outreach Program, started by Hanna Wallach and Chris Ball

* 100 (women) applicants

* Structure: Same as GSoC: mentored coding internship. (Separate funding.)

* Conclusion: Targeted outreach changes the behaviors we see!

GNOME Women's Outreach Project
=====

Open questions:

.. rst-class:: build

* Do Women's Outreach Project particpants stick around in GNOME similarly to other summer interns?

* (Maybe more. Maybe less.)

The study no one has done yet
======

.. rst-class:: build

* Select 200 random users on e.g. Github

* Find out their demographic information

* Watch their activity levels

* (This is hypothetical for now. Your project?)

2010: Open Source Comes to Campus
====

.. rst-class:: build

* 30% of applicants were women

* and 30% of most excited applicants!

* so, 30% of attendees

* No gender-specific outreach

* Great two-day event

* ...though, did we leave an impact?

* To track: Compare Github activity against other similar population

Clones popping up

.. rst-class:: build

* PyStar Philly

* Chicago Python Workshop

* Columbus Python Workshop

* Beginners & Friends Python Programming Workshop in Auckland, NZ

* Tying them all together as OpenHatch Affiliated Events

Probable limitation(s):

.. rst-class:: build

* Only applies if you can hijack existing group

Set goals, and then achieve them
====

.. rst-class:: build

* PSF grant to OpenHatch: program began June 1

* Six new intro/diversity events

* Eight groups see improved speaker diversity

Wikipedia bot messages -- does niceness matter?
====

.. rst-class:: build

* Huggle!

* N approx 10,000

Wikipedia bot messages
====

.. rst-class:: build

* "Changing the tone and language of the generic vandalism warning.."

* increasing the personalization (active voice rather than passive, explicitly stating that the sender of the warning is also a volunteer editor, including an explicit invitation to contact them with questions)

* decreasing the number of directives and links

* and decreasing the length of the message

* ...led to more users editing articles in the short term.

* More: http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Template_A/B_testing/Results

* Clarity, not niceness.

Project-driven continuous metric tracking

* Goal: Illuminate community activity

* Bugzilla, mailing list submissions, wiki edits

* http://wiki.meego.com/Metrics/Dashboard

* A thrilling ball of Tomcat, Pentaho, and MySQL

* Primary goal: Show managers what "community" is

MediaWiki community health
====

.. rst-class:: build

* What are the areas with more activity?

* Are we expanding or shrinking?

* Custom gerrit stats: http://gerrit-stats.wmflabs.org/

* Bitergia's MetricsGrimoire project:

  * 2012 November preview: bugzilla <http://bitergia.com/public/previews/2012_11_mediawiki/its.html>

  * 2012 November preview: mailing list statistics <http://bitergia.com/public/previews/2012_11_mediawiki/mls.html

  * Now, monthly reports + dashboard

  * FIXME: Find those


Ubuntu Developer Advisory Team
====

.. rst-class:: build

* This team in terms of UbuntuDevelopment, tries to fulfill the following tasks in the Ubuntu world:

* Reach out to new contributors, thank them for their work and get feedback.

* Reach out to people who might be ready to apply for upload rights and help them.

* Reach out to contributors that went inactive and get feedback from them and offer help.

Ubuntu DAT: New Contributor Report
====

.. rst-class:: build

* DAT asked open-ended questions; 63% response rate

* 9 love Launchpad; 9 dislike it

* Reviews are "surprisingly painless"

* Docs are troublesome: "overwhelmed at all the information" and by "contradictory information" that is "difficult to follow in a logical manner"

* Contributing is a "surprisingly painless process"

* Real magic is in the Trello cards...

Ubuntu DAT: Continous tracking
====

.. rst-class:: build

* Data from Ultimate Debian Database

* General approach: Make people happy, rather than tell them what to do

* ...but does it work?

* To answer that question: OpenHatch Greenhouse
